# moodpatch

MoodPatch is a colorful mood tracking app. So people know they are not alone, they can see other (anonymous) users' moods, as well as tracking, editing, or deleting their own moods.

This repo is just moodpatch's planning and project materials, mostly found under [projects](https://github.com/ctavispost/moodpatch/projects/1). See the [frontend](https://github.com/ctavispost/moodPatch_frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/ctavispost/moodPatch_backend) for more.
