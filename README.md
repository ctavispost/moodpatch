# moodpatch

MoodPatch is a colorful mood tracking app. It allows people to track their own moods and, so they know they are not alone, to see how other people in general are doing.

This repo is just moodpatch's planning and project materials, mostly found under [projects](https://github.com/ctavispost/moodpatch/projects/1). See the [frontend](https://github.com/ctavispost/moodPatch_frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/ctavispost/moodPatch_backend) for more.
